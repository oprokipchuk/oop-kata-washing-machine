# OOP Washing Machine Kata

This is my implementation of the washing machine kata.

## Requirements

* Must provide dedicated programs for a different type of fabric; supported ones are wool, cotton and silk
* Programs for fabrics must be adjustable in the matter of temperature and spin speed
    * Wool can be washed only in temperature up to 40°C, with spin speed between 100 and 400 rounds per minute
    * Cotton can be washed in temperature between 30 and 95°C, with spin speed up to 1200 RPM
    * The maximum temperature for silk is 30°C and up to 300 RPM
* The washer should have protection for putting over 7 kilograms of laundries
* The default value for temperature and spin speed will be its maximum value
